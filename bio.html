	  <hr><hr />
	  <p class = "content">My name is Kathryn Roland and I am a junior at Tufts University.  I am studying Human Factors Engineering, a subset of mechanical engineering that focuses on user experience and user interfaces, and minoring in Engineering Management.  The skill set that I have gained from this unique major includes analyzing user needs, implementing web data analytics, and collaborating within a team. </p>
	  <p class = "content"> Last summer I worked as a Data Analyst Intern for the CTO of EverQuote, a startup turned small company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I used Python to handle large data sets and analyze the data. I also used other SEO programming tools, such as Gephi, to visualize the website’s and its competitors’ internal linking.  We tried to maximize the company’s attractiveness to Google and other search engines. My conclusions directly impacted the company’s SEO decisions.  This dynamic experience confirmed that the tech industry is the one I want a career in. </p>
	  <p class = "content">An interesting aspect of my major is the emphasis on human computer interaction. I have taken two courses in C++, which allowed me to quickly learn Python.  I also recently taught myself HTML. This Spring semester I am taking courses in web programming, human computer interaction, and computer interface design. The focus of my major’s core classes is to increase awareness of our surroundings and use that information to create new products or revamp old ones. In addition to my engineering courses, I have successfully completed statistics and science courses.</p>
	  <p class = "content">I hope to one day work in the tech industry.  For now, I spend my time reading, trying new restaurants, trying to see as much live theatre as I possibly can, and spending time with my family and friends!
