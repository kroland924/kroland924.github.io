# 1. Overall, my design has been implemented very well.  The navigation from the index to the resume.html and the bio.html were successfully 
# working.  And all html and css files passed in the online checker.  The styling through the css files was meant to be sleek and simple.  Overall
# a successful first Comp20 assignment.
